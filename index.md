What:
-----

Swinburne Hacker Within is a two-hour weekly informal meetup for Swinburne PhD students, technical staff involved in big-data projects, and researchers at all levels and from all disciplines. It's about learning new web-skills, gaining experience with programming languages, trouble shooting existing problems, and helping one another to create innovative research tools and projects to enhance your research (or other interests). It's mainly about having fun, sharing ideas, and finding your hacker within.

No previous programming/hacking experience is necessary. Each session will be based around a theme and will include a
short talk or demonstration to generate ideas. Researchers are welcome to follow along, or just work independently or
in groups on their on their own projects. Participants are encouraged to work together, share ideas and skills, and 
propose topics for future sessions.

Initial sessions will focus on data visualisation tools for research, creating research websites and blogs, and learning about software repositories like GitHub and useful tools to make programming easier, e.g. iPython Notebook. More advanced topics may be thrown in from time to time.

Where & When: 
-----

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre (AMDC) Room 206. Nominally <strong>every Wednesday from 1-3pm unless otherwise stated</strong>. See the list of <a href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/upcoming.html">upcoming topics</a> for specific dates and times.


Who:
-----

PhDs and researchers at all levels from all disciplines - social sciences, biosciences, engineering, astronomy, business, design, everyone!.  Anyone interested in learing how to use GitHub to write and share code, create data visualisations from research data, learn Python (iPython Notebooks), Julia, web design (HTML, CSS), CartoDB mapping, D3js and TimelineJS visualisations, turning spreasheets into databases and kickstarting new projects for research or outreach.

First time hackers need not be afraid! We will help set up laptops. You will be creating websites and small projects in no time. 


How:
-----

Participating is really easy. Just bring your laptop, ideas, enthusiasm, and coffee mug (optional - there is a kitchen next door). If you have data you want to work on then bring that too.

<ul>
<li> At <b>1:00pm</b> we meet, go through a quick round of introductions for those who are new, and post session ideas/projects onto the whiteboard.</li><br>
<li> Every second week someone will give a short tutorial or lead a discussion about a topic, or introduce a new web tool they recently discovered. This topic can be anything. It may be some new skill you have recently picked up in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, an overview of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.</li><br>
<li> The rest of the session will be spent learning new tools, or working on new projects. There will be plenty of time for Lightning Talks, 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to the group. Note that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here’s the place to ask many ears about it at once.</li>

</ul>

The Hacker Within relies on peer-driven teaching, so please volunteer to lead a topic or discussion. If you have any other questions about the meetup feel free to email the organiser.

Background:
------

The tenets of scientiﬁc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
control, automated documentation, and others.


To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after <a href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io">The 
Hacker Within</a> which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
the chapters convenes a community of researchers, at all levels of their 
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
using computing to accomplish their work.
