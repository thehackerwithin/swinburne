What:
-----

Swinburne Hacker Within is a two-hour weekly informal meetup for Swinburne PhD students and researchers at all levels and from all disciplines It's about sharing ideas, learning how to use existing web-based tools, building up programming skills and helping one another to create innovative research tools and projects to enhance your research (or other interests). It's mainly about having fun and learning new skills.

No previous programming/hacking experience is necessary. Each session will be based around a theme and will include a short talk or demonstration to generate ideas. Researchers are welcome to follow along, or just work independently or in groups on their on their own projects. Participants are encouraged to work together, share ideas and skills, and suggest topics for future sessions.

Initial sessions will focus on data visualisation tools for research, creating research websites and blogs, and learning about software repositories like GitHub and tools like iPython notebook. More advanced topics may be thrown in from time to time. Researchers from ALL disciplines are welcome to come along.

Organiser: Arna Karick (akarick@swin.edu.au)

Where & When: 
-----

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre (AMDC) Room 206. Typically every Wednesday (or Thursday) between 1 and 3pm. See 'Upcoming Events' for specific dates and times.


Who:
-----

PhDs and researchers at all levels from all disciplines (social sciences, biosciences, engineering, astronomy, business, design, everyone!). Basically Anyone interested in learing how to use GitHub to write and share code, create data visualisations from research data, learn Python (iPython Notebooks), Julia, web design (HTML, CSS), CartoDB mapping, D3js and TimelineJS visualisations, turning spreasheets into databases and kickstarting new projects for research or outreach.

First time hackers don't be afraid!  We will help set up laptops and you'll be creating websites and small projects in no time. 


How:
-----

Participating is really easy. Just bring your laptop, ideas, enthusiasm, and optional coffee mug (there is a kitchen next door). If you have any questions about the meetup feel free to email me directly.


Background:
------

The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
control, automated documentation, and others.


To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The 
Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their 
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
using computing to accomplish their work.
