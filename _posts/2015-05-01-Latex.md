## Elliott Biondo

I am a fourth year graduate student in nuclear engineering working under Paul
Wilson. My research is in radiation transport methods for nuclear activation
problems encountered in fusion energy devices.

I have been using LaTeX/Beamer for nearly every document I compose,
since the beginning of my second year of graduate school.

## LaTex/Beamer

LaTeX is a powerful, widely-used markup language used to prepare documents.
Beamer is a component of LaTeX used for making presentations. Together these
tools offer an (in my opinion much better) alternative to standard
word-processing and presentation software.

The benefits of LaTeX include absolute control over every detail, a full-featured
math mode, automatic handling of equations, citations, tables, figures, and
code listings. In the spirit of this student group, LaTeX is highly hackable.
Perhaps most importantly, LaTeX is entirely text-based, so every aspect of a
LaTeX document can be version controlled (but that's a topic for another
time!). 

This presentation will start with some simple and practical LaTeX and Beamer
examples. Input files will be provided [here][repo], so audience members can follow along if
they'd like. Once everyone is up-to-speed on the basics, some intermediate/advanced features will be demonstrated.
