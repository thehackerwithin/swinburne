## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 15th July from 1:30 - 3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this
session. Feel free to use this time to catch up on previous SHW
sessions, work on your own projects, or brush up your coding
skills. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) to begin with. Examples of
projects created by SHW participants can be found
[here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html). We
generally work to music... ([BBC 6
Music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music))


## Creating interactive visualisation of research plots

For those who want to want to practise javascript and html I'll be
using D3js to create some interacting figures of research plots. I'm
following the examples from Sudeepp Das's (Data Scientist at
Astrophysicist) [datamusing blog](http://datamusing.info).

Although the visualisations won't go into the actual paper, I know
they'll be useful,and in this format can be sharing with collaborators
via a simple GitHub webpage.
