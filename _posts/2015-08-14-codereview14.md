## Where & When?

AR Building - Room 209. Friday 14th August from 4pm.<br>

## About Code Review

Astronomy Code Review is organised by [Ewan Barr](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/staff/ebarr.html) and [Neil Crighton](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/staff/ncrighton.html). Once a fortnight Ewan and Neil host a code review/tutorial session open to all members of the Centre for Astrophysics Supercomputing (CAS). Primarily this acts as a help desk / discussion forum / review panel for scientific computing for astronomy researchers. These sessions are informal and CAS researchers are encouraged to bring along problems that they have that can be discussed with experts (one-on-one) or with a wider group. In the event of no specific topic or problem to address, the session will be used for some rapid tutorials into various languages and tools that will help turn you into a productive coder capable of producing extensible, well designed, functional code with the minimum of effort.

All tutorials will be live-coded and the code and outputs will be hosted on [GitHub - CAS Code Review](https://github.com/ewanbarr/CAS_Code_Review) for people to download and play with.

## This weeks topic - Bring your code for review

Ideally if you have a problem, copy and paste it into [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/) so that others can assess the problem prior to the code review session. Alternatively initiate a discussion on the #code_review Slack channel.

## Who should attend

These Friday afternoon code review sessions are primariy for astronomy researchers. Non-astronomers wishing to partipate should contact Ewan or Neil directly.
