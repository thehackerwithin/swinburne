## About CartoDB and TimelineJS

<a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> and TimelineJS are simple web-based visualisation tools that require very little programming/computational skills. I think they are a really good starting point for researchers new to hacking, and they offer a quick adn easy way to play around with visualising data from all disciplines.

**CartoDB** is essentially a map building web application. It's free for the academic community and really easy to set up. You just need to be able to manipulate spreadsheets and have a baseic understanding of geocoding. Check out the <a href="http://cartodb.com/gallery/">CartoDB Map Gallery</a>. A few months ago I spent a couple of hours creating this <a href="http://drarnakarick.cartodb.com/viz/9eefe1ba-179b-11e4-af10-0e10bcd91c2b/public_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=true&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=2&center_lat=25.77189348043032&center_lon=0"> interactive map of optical and radio telescopes</a>around the world.
