## About CartoDB and TimelineJS

<a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> and <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com">TimelineJS</a> are simple web-based visualisation tools that require very little programming/computational skills. I think they are a really good starting point for researchers new to hacking, and they offer a quick adn easy way to play around with visualising data from all disciplines.

**CartoDB** is essentially a map building web application. It's free for the academic community and really easy to set up. You just need to be able to manipulate spreadsheets and have a baseic understanding of geocoding. Check out the <a href="http://cartodb.com/gallery/">CartoDB Map Gallery</a>. 

Example: This <a href="http://drarnakarick.cartodb.com/viz/9eefe1ba-179b-11e4-af10-0e10bcd91c2b/public_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=true&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=2&center_lat=25.77189348043032&center_lon=0"> interactive map of optical and radio telescopes</a> around the world took me less than hour to set up. It's still a work in progress. I updated it whenever I need to take a mental break from work. Most of the data was taken from dare I say it... Wikipedia.

**TimelineJS** is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually,rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can create a timeline using nothing more than a Google spreadsheet. Experts can use their JSON skills to create custom installations, while keeping TimelineJS's core look and functionality. It can pull in media from a variety of sources and has built-in support for Twitter, Flickr, Google Maps, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Wikipedia, SoundCloud and more.

Example: Using TimelineJS, I created an  <a href="http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Ew3qdqfPaDemmBy0zsdyBlL0QFCulJKqL_4Kea_AMWw&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650"> interactive timeline</a> for the new <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/utmost">UTMOST radio array</a>. The UTMOST project is an upgrade of the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), the largest radio telescope in the Southern hemisphere. The data and images were taken from the <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/research/utmost/?page_id=312">Timeline</a> page on the UTMOST website.
