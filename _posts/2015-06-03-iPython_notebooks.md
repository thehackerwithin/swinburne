## About IPython Notebook
The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. It aims to be an agile tool for both exploratory computation and data analysis, and provides a platform to support reproducible research, since all inputs and outputs may be stored in a one-to-one way in notebook documents.

<strong>Some of the main features of the IPython Notebook app include:</strong>

* Display rich data representations (e.g. HTML / LaTeX / SVG) in the browser as a result of computations.
* Compose rich text using Markdown and HTML.
* Include mathematical equations, rendered directly in the browser by MathJax.
* Import standard Python scripts.
* In-browser editing, syntax highlighting, tab completion and autoindentation.
* Inline figures rendered by the matplotlib library with publication quality, in a range of formats (SVG / PDF / PNG).
