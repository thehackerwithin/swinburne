This week's Swinburne Hacker Within (SHW) topic is iPython Notebooks. We will briefly go through the basics of launching a Notebook and how you can make them public. We will also look at some online examples. Experienced IPython Notebook users please come along and share your tips and tricks. You are most welcome to demo your own Notebooks.

## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 3rd June from 1:30 - 3pm.

## About IPython Notebook
The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. It aims to be an agile tool for both exploratory computation and data analysis, and provides a platform to support reproducible research, since all inputs and outputs may be stored in a one-to-one way in notebook documents. These notebooks are files which record all computations carried out and the results obtained in a literate way, including inputs, outputs, together with descriptive text and mathematics.

They are plain text files, which are thus easy to share with colleagues and place under version control. But, by using the JSON format, they can record all aspects of the computation, including embedding rich media output. The standard file extension for notebook documents is .ipynb. [Examples of notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)

###Features of the IPython Notebook app include:###

* Display rich data representations (e.g. HTML / LaTeX / SVG) in the browser as a result of computations.
* Compose rich text using Markdown and HTML.
* Include mathematical equations, rendered directly in the browser by MathJax.
* Import standard Python scripts.
* In-browser editing, syntax highlighting, tab completion and autoindentation.
* Inline figures rendered by the matplotlib library with publication quality, in a range of formats (SVG / PDF / PNG).

###Resources to help you get started###

* [Getting Started with the IPython Notebook](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/12/12/start-ipython-notebook/). A  succinct step-by-step guide to installing and launching Notebooks.
* For a thorough introduction to the IPython Notebook, you can check out the [IPython in Depth tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=xe_ATRmw0KM) from the SciPy 2013 scientific Python conference, led by the two creators of the IPython package, Fernando PÃ©rez and Brian Granger
* IPython [Notebook tutorial](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/Astr599/notebooks/03_IPython_intro) by [Jake VanderPlas](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/), a research astronomer and Director of Research for Physical Sciences at UW's eScience Institute.
* Some random notes from Berkeley's Hacker Within [session on IPython Notebook](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/posts/ipython/) that talk about IPython Notebooks, GitHub and Magics.

##What we talked about##
After a bit of a rocky start (room booking/ITS issues - apologies folks) we launched straight into a somewhat haphazard discussion about who currently uses IPython Notebooks, why you might want to use it, the emerging culture of open data and reproducible science, and current issues faced by new users. We then looked at a couple of examples of simple notebooks on the web. Here is the IPython Notebook I started on Crisis Mapping in Nepal (very much work in progress). BTW - keep my notebooks in a separate '/user/akarick/Notebook/' directory, and launch 'akarick> ipython notebook' from there. [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org) is a really useful site for sharing notebooks and I've found some good examples of research notebooks (check out this [Evolution of Swarming](http://www.randalolson.com/2012/05/12/a-short-demo-on-how-to-use-ipython-notebook-as-a-research-notebook/) notebook which can be downloaded along with data files) and tutorials on web-scraping (e.g. [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition])(http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrmontag/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/blob/master/ipynb/Chapter%201%20-%20Mining%20Twitter.ipynb).
