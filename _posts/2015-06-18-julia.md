## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Thursday 18th June from 3:30-5:30pm.

## Introduction to Julia Programming Language

Interested in learning about the Julia programming language? Alex Codoreanu will be leading a guided tutorial/workshop on Julia. No experience necessary. If you've never heard of Julia but what to see what it's all about please come along.  Those wishing to listen in while working on other projects are welcome to come along too.


## Alex Codoreanu

Alex is a PhD student from the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing. His research focusses on understanding the absorption profiles observed in the spectra of quasars, specifically looking at the relative strengths of different ionization states of Carbon, Oxygen, Silicon and other metals.

## About Julia

[Julia](http://julialang.org) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. Juliaâ€™s Base library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed open source C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.

Julia is designed for parallelism and cloud computing. It provides a number of key building blocks for distributed computation, making it flexible enough to support a number of styles of parallelism, and allowing users to add more. Like Python, users can lanch the web-based interactive Jupyter Notebook (formerly IJulia Notebook), using [Gadfly](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl).
