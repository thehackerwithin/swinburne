## Where & When?

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Thursday 23rd April from 1-3pm.<br>
<b>Note the change to Thursday (this week only)</b>

## Coding session

In the previous session we discussed how Swinburne Hacker Within will work, what we want to get out of it, and went through a number of examples of what sort of projects and visualisations people could create. We talked a lot (!!), but I really appreciated your thoughts. During the session Samara sneakily managed to create her first TimelineJS visualisation.

This week we'll hit the ground running. For those who want to start working on a TimelineJS visualisation or a CartoDB map, see below if you want to get started earlier. Otherwise bring your data, project, idea and start hacking.

As for me, I'll be figuring out how to make an interactive plot using D3js that looks something like this: <a href="http://datamusing.info/blog/2014/09/03/the-case-for-interactive-visualizations-in-astrophysics/"> Interactive visualizations in astrophysics - plot 1 </a>

See you there - Arna
