## Hacky Hour & e-Research Coffee

As AMDC206 is unavailable this week, we will be combining Hacky Hour with e-Research Coffee (normally held on Thursdays)

## Where & When

Haddons Cafe. Wednesday 26th August from 1:30-3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this
session. Feel free to use this time to catch up on previous SHW
sessions, work on your own projects, or brush up your coding
skills. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), Future Learn and 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). Examples of
projects created by SHW participants can be found
[here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html). We
generally work to music... ([BBC 6
Music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music))


## Who?

If you would like to lead a discussion please contact the organiser.


## Hosted by

* Arna Karick, SHW organiser & e-Research Consultant (Swinburne Research)
