## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 13th May from 1-3pm.

## Arna Karick & Samara Neilson

Arna is Swinburneâ€™s e-Research Consultant, the organiser of Swinburne Hacker Within, and an astronomer by trade. Samara is Swinburne's Research Data Coordinator and co-developer of the SR Analytics and ERA system for Swinburne Research. Both of these incorporate D3js.org data visualisations of information such as publication data, research grants and income etc.

## What we plan on doing 

This week we'll look at how to create minimalist websites like the <a href="http://evilangelpixie.github.io/d3js/">Week 3 D3js lesson plan </a> that Samara created. This may serve as somewhere to embed your D3js visualisations. We'll also keep working on D3js projects/tutorials and introduce more advanced elements if people want to develop things further.
