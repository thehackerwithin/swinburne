## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 13th May from 1-3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this session. Feel free to use this time to work on a new project, go through some of the work we did at last weeks Software Carpentry workshop, or brush up your coding skills by working through an online course. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) to begin with. Examples of projects created by SHW participants can be found [here] (http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html)
