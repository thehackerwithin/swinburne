## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 1st July from 1:30-3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this session. Feel free to use this time to catch up on previous SHW sessions, work on your own projects, or brush up your coding skills. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) to begin with. Examples of projects created by SHW participants can be found [here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html). We generally work to music...

## Crising Mapping in Nepal

For those who want to start contributing to a project, I'll be working on the [Crisis Mapping for Nepal](http://netengine.com.au/projects/crisis-mapping/) project. There is a tutorial to teach you how you can contribute and you don't need a great deal of coding skills to do so. The project has received quite a lot of attention and I think really is actually helping the aid groups on the ground.
