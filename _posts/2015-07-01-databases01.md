Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Thursday 1st July from 1:30-3pm.

## Introduction to relational databases with SQL

Have you ever wondered how transactional websites (e.g. ebay, amazon) retrieve the items that you search for, or how your employer generates your payslips? Most use a [Relational Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Relational_database): a structured solution to represent and manage data.

Relational databases are also very useful to run analytics (data mining) on large quantities of data. To interact and query the database, a simple language called [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=SQL) (sometimes pronounced 'sequal') is used.

Such powerful tools can be extremely useful for researchers from all disciplines, from astronomy to social economics.
In this session, I will introduce Relational Databases (e.g. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)) and cover the basics of the SQL language.

### Installing software

**sqlite3** comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and Linux. Windows uers can follow the Software Carpentry SQLite installation [instructions](http://drarnakarick.github.io/2015-05-04-swinpython/).

**Don't forget to bring your laptop! All operating systems welcome.**
