## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 10th June from 1:30-3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this session. Feel free to use this time to catch up on previous SHW sessions, work on your own projects, or brush up your coding skills. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) to begin with. Examples of projects created by SHW participants can be found [here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html). We generally work to music.

## What we worked on

* Creating websites in GitHub.
* Transport modelling using Java, R and AGIS (mapping software).
* Setting up Git with [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), rather [Git for Mac] (https://mac.github.com) - a bit clunky).

## What we talked about

* How to set up SQL databases.
* Julia programming prep for next week.
* How Git, Mercurial, SourceTree, Git for Mac, GitHub and Bitbucket relate to each other.

## Attended by

* Arna Karick, SHW organiser & e-Research Consultant & astro by trade (Swinburne Research)
* Nicole Ronald, Research staff (Dept of Computer Science and Software Engineering)
* Samara Neilson & Research Data Coordinator (Swinburne Research)
