## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 10th June from 1:30-3pm.

## General coding and project work

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this session. Feel free to use this time to catch up on previous SHW sessions, work on your own projects, or brush up your coding skills. We recommend [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) to begin with. Examples of projects created by SHW participants can be found [here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html). We generally work to music.

## What we worked on

* Building websites using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* Transport modelling using Java, R and AGIS mapping software.
* Setting up Git with [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), rather [Git for Mac](https://mac.github.com) - which is a bit clunky.
* Understanding multi-stage SQL queries for a project.

## What we talked about


* Julia programming prep for next week.
* How Git, Mercurial, SourceTree, Git for Mac, GitHub and Bitbucket relate to each other.
* Samara gave some advice about multi-stage SQL database queries for a CTI project and the merits of SourceTree. 

**This is what Hacky Hour is all about. Helping each other to solve research problems.**
