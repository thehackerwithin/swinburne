## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 29th April from 1-3pm.

## Samara Neilson

Samara is Swinburne Research's Data Coordinator and co-developer of the SR Analytics and ERA system for Swinburne Research. Both of these incorporate D3js.org data visualisations of information such as publication data, research grants and income etc. 

## Introduction to visualisation using D3js Data Driven Documents 

Samara will lead a tutorial on getting started with D3js.org. This will include a short into to Javascript. Hopefully by the end of the session everyone will have created two D3js visualisations.

## About D3js

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. 

The trickiest bit is getting your data in a format that works for D3js.org
