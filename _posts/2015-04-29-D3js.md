## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 29th April from 1-3pm.

## Samara Neilson

Samara is Swinburne Research's Data Coordinator and co-developer of the SR Analytics and ERA system for Swinburne Research. Both of these incorporate D3js.org data visualisations of information such as publication data, research grants and income etc. 

## Visualisation using D3js Data-Driven Documents 

Samara will lead an introductory tutorial on using D3js.org for data visualisation. This will include a short into to Javascript. Hopefully by the end of the session everyone will have created two D3js visualisations.

## About D3js

<a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a> is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. 

The trickiest bit is getting your data in a format that works for D3js.org and learning a bit of Javascript. If you want to get started, Mike Bostock - the creator of D3js - has some  <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">examples</a> you can work through. Samara suggests starting with bar charts.
