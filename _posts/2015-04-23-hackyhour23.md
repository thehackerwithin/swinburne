## Where & When?

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Thursday 23rd April from 1-3pm.<br>
<b>Note the change to Thursday (this week only)</b>

## Coding session

In the previous session we discussed how Swinburne Hacker Within (SHW) will work, what we want to get out of it, and went through a number of examples of what sort of projects and visualisations people could create. We talked a lot (!!), but I really appreciated your thoughts. During the session Samara sneakily managed to create her first TimelineJS visualisation, a BioWare Studio Timeline.

This week we'll hit the ground running, following the normal SHW format. For those who want to start working on a TimelineJS visualisation or a CartoDB map, see below. Otherwise bring your data, project, idea and start hacking.

As for me, I'll be figuring out how to make an interactive plot using D3js that looks something like this: <a href="http://datamusing.info/blog/2014/09/03/the-case-for-interactive-visualizations-in-astrophysics/"> Interactive visualizations in astrophysics - plot 1</a>. Happy to help others where I can.

See you then - Arna

## What we worked on

Data visualisation seemed to be the topic of the day with an interest in Javascript and D3js. Iman led a really nice discussion about the semiology of graphics and how data should be visualised and how these are percieved by others.  There is book called the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Semiology-Graphics-Diagrams-Networks-Maps/dp/1589482611"> Semiology of Graphics</a> which is available at the Swinburne University Library (ironically this copy is in black and white). Iman also showed us some great blogs and a nice post about the <a href=" http://fellinlovewithdata.com/guides/the-hidden-legacy-of-bertin-and-the-semiology-of-graphics">semiology of graphics</a>, which I've added to the growing <a  href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io/swinburne/links.html"> list of links</a>. Meanwhile Elodie whipped up an interactive timeline for the <a href="http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/embed/index.html?source=0AtZUlHbzLE_hdHJSeTZldGJJQW5RMFpfY0ZadjFDUGc&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&start_at_end=true&height=650">PLATYPUS survey</a>: a southern debris disk survey at 7mm.
