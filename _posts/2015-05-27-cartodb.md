## Where & When

Advanced Manufacturing and Design Centre - Room 206. Wednesday 27th May from 1:30 - 3pm.

##About CartoDB 

[CartoDB](https://cartodb.com) is essentially a map building web application. It’s free for the academic community and really easy to set up. You just need to be able to manipulate spreadsheets and have a baseic understanding of geocoding. CartoDB allows you to put your data on top of rich base layers. Use Mapbox or any other basemap provider. You can even create maps without a background. CartoDB integrates with all major mapping and visualization engines through its mapping library, CartoDB.js. Check out the CartoDB Map Gallery for ideas.  You a can also fork the  CartoDB Javascript library from GitHub to create your own maps from scratch.

Example: This interactive map of optical and radio telescopes around the world took me less than hour to set up. It’s still a work in progress. I updated it whenever I need to take a mental break from work. Most of the data was taken from, dare I say it, Wikipedia.

## Copyright issues around data and visualisations.

Robin Wright from the Copyright office will also be popping in to discuss issues about open access data and options such as Creative Commons for making visualisationds available online. Participants are welcome to join in this informal discussion.
