##About CartoDB 

This week's SHW topic is CartoDB mapping for researchers. [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com) is essentially a map building web application. You can create [unlimited public maps for free](https://cartodb.com/pricing-features). It's very easy to start once you activate your account.   You just need to be able to manipulate spreadsheets and have a basic understanding of geocoding. CartoDB allows you to put your data on top of rich base layers. Use Mapbox or any other basemap provider. You can even create maps without a background. CartoDB integrates with all major mapping and visualization engines through its mapping library, CartoDB.js. Check out the [CartoDB Map Gallery](https://cartodb.com/gallery/) for ideas. You can also fork the [CartoDB Javascript library](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb.js/) from GitHub to create your own maps from scratch.

**Example:** This [interactive map of optical and radio telescopes](http://drarnakarick.cartodb.com/viz/9eefe1ba-179b-11e4-af10-0e10bcd91c2b/public_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=true&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=2&center_lat=25.77189348043032&center_lon=0) around the world took an afternoon to set up. It’s still a work in progress. update it whenever I need to take a mental break from work. Most of the data was taken from, dare I say it, Wikipedia. You can read my [original blog post here](https://chasingtelescopes.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/my-very-own-hack-day-mapping-for-researchers/). The map is interactive in the sense that you can zoom in, move around, hover and click on telescopes and click on links that take you to external observatory websites. The visualisation is public as is the underlying CartoDB [data table](http://drarnakarick.cartodb.com/tables/telescopes_around_the_world/public) which can be downloaded in various formats.

### Guided Tutorials ###
CartoDB now provides some additional resources and account options for the [academic community](https://cartodb.com/industries/education-and-research/) and they now have courses online at [CartoDB Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com). For a guided tutorial on CartoDB basics check out the [Online Mapping for Beginners](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/01-beginners-course.html) course.


## Copyright issues around data and visualisations.

Robin Wright from the Copyright office will also be popping in to discuss issues about open access data and options such as Creative Commons for making visualisations available online. Participants are welcome to join in this informal discussion.
